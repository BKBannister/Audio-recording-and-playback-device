# Audio recording and playback device

This project aimed to develop a device capable of recording 30 seconds of audio through its integrated microphone and storing it across three channels. The device incorporates a power supply, along with a user-friendly interface comprising five buttons: Record, Channel 1, Channel 2, Channel 3, and Stop, as well as an audio AUX jack. Playback of recorded audio is facilitated through the AUX jack port by pressing the corresponding channel button.
